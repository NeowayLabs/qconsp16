# Dude talking about lambda


Lambda seems pretty magic to run stuff, already handles autoscaling.

Some cons:

* Lose too much control
* Dependency hell all over again (build zip with everything)
* Distance between prod/dev :-(
* Support to few languages only (no golang :-()


# The Spotify Playlist


## Struggles


### Deadlines

* Integrating with hardware vendors (add support to devices)
* Hard deadlines, defined on advance
* Put spotify on as much devices as possible generates too much WIP


### Assume people knows agile

* Just dont assume stuff :-)


## Wins

* Radical transparency (even on business stuff)
* Changes how the employee see the company
* Builds trust
* Empower developer
* Self organize
* Allow people to choose on what they want to work
* Continuous improvement :P


## Why different ?

* We use our product (dog food)
* Try to behave as a startup
* Internal open source model (everything is public within the company)
* Anyone can pull request on any project
* Favors people that take risks
* Counter intuitive bets (very different model than iTunes on start)
* Deliberate focus on culture (workshops, talks, constantly iterating)
* Train people on how to give feedback
* Celebrates failure (blog posts about it :-)
* Simple rules
* No projects/budgets/project managers
* Management happens within the team
* Team that goes around fixing flaky tests :-)
* Highly technical PO's
* Two hackweeks per year
